## Letâ€™s create a football tournament with 4 teams playing against each other. 
# Each team should have a name and all the teams will play matches against each other. 
# If a team wins the match, it receives 3 points, if it ties it receives 1 point and if it loses, it receives no point. 
# Below are the scores for the tournament.
# Team A 3 x 1 Team B
# Team C 0 x 0 Team D
# . . .
# Create a program that receives these match results and displays the final tournament standings table in order 
# (first team with the most points received; last team with the least points received).
